「生産性が高いですね！」

「律儀ですね！」

「カッコいいですね！」

オーケー。多分、最後のやつは勘違いかもしれません。しかし、最初の2つの褒め言葉については私は2回以上受けました。「ここでは何も完遂することができない!」というフラストレーションを抱えながら、このポジティブなフィードバックをしかたなく受け入れています。

それでも私は、私の日々の仕事に対するアプローチをあなたに共有します。そこで得られる称賛が、あなたにふさわしいものかどうかはあなたが決めてください。私の生産性テクニックの中心は「**チャンク・テクニック**」と呼ぶものです。

- チャンキング ([心理学における説明](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology))) とは、記憶が行われる際の、個々の **ひとかたまりとなっている反応** による現象のこと。
- チャンキング ([文章術における説明](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(writing))) とは、情報を小さな断片にして　**概念を分割** することで情報を伝える手法のこと。

ご覧のとおり、チャンクとは、小さなものを大きなチャンクにグループ化することと、大きなものを小さなチャンクに分割することの両方を意味します。

私が仕事をするときは、その両方をやっています。


### チャンキング
**作業のチャンクとは、約10分から1時間の間に行われる集中的なアクティビティのことで、平均は30分未満です。**

作業のチャンクは、メールボックスを空にするなど、完全に自己完結したタスクになります。しかし、新規のプレゼンテーションにおける最初のリハーサルのような、より大きなプロジェクトから切り出された、ちゃんと定義されたスライスでもあります。逆のことも言えます。to-doリストにある10個ぐらいの、うざったい小さなタスクをまとめて終わらすような、関連性のない小さなタスクを寄せ集めた集合だったりもします。言い換えると、チャンクとは10分から60分でできる明確に定義されたアクティビティのことで、単一の完全なタスクのこともあれば、またはそれよりも大きなタスクの一部だったり、はたまた、いくつかの小さなタスクのグループだったりします。

チャンクには3つの重要な要件があります。

- 不自然でく、論理的に、開始時間と終了時間が決まっていること
- 邪魔による中断がされないこと (選択の余地がない場合を除く)
- チャンクとチャンクの間の休憩はウェルカム (むしろ望ましい)


### 例: 先週金曜日のチャンク

先週金曜日の最初のチャンクは、朝食を取ってから 9:15 に家を出て、チームメンバーの Nicolas の家まで車で行き、彼と新しい動画のレコーディングを始めることでした。10時にはオンラインチームのハングアウトが予定されていたので、この動画撮影が 45 分で終わることが分かっていました。

2番目のチャンクはチームのハングアウトでしたが、驚くほど短いものでした。チームメンバーがとても少なかったんです。なので、それはちょうど 20 分でした。

3番目のチャンクには Nicolas にも参加してもらって、私はいくつか新しい動画撮影を続けて、それから家に帰ってきました。これはちょうど 60 分かかりました。邪魔による中断は許しませんでした。メール、ダメ。ツイッター、ダメ。フェイスブック、ダメ。私は動画作成だけに集中しました。明らかに、金曜日におけるこれら2つの「動画作成チャンク」は、より大きなプロジェクトの一部と言えます。動画を3つ新しく撮影し、公開することでした。

家に帰ってからは 10 分間のコーヒーブレイクを取りました。

4番目のチャンクは、夜に受信したすべてのメールと、Twitter、Slack、Facebook、LinkedInの質問や通知を処理するというタスクを集めたものでした。このチャンクは 35 分の作業で、その後すべてのチャネルがクリアになりました。このチャンクは、全く無関係なアクティビティのグループです。それらには共通点があり、それをやっている間、私は「返信モード」にいて、単純に何十ものメッセージに返信するという点でのみ似ていました。

Chunk number five took only 10 minutes: posting and scheduling some interesting articles I had found the night before. For me this is a recurring two-chunk activity: reading in bed at night for about 30 minutes, and then posting articles for about 10 minutes the next morning. This is always two chunks, separated by a good night’s sleep.

Chunk six was supposed to take at least half an hour, but I had to stop after 15 minutes. While testing our new Management 3.0 web shop I ran into issues that had to be resolved before I could continue. A nice example of an interrupted chunk!

I then spent 35 minutes on chunk number seven: collecting and preparing images for one of the three videos we had recorded this morning. It was finished after I had sent the images to Nicolas. I will have to do the same for the other two videos, but those will be chunks for later. I have done enough (for now) to keep Nicolas unblocked. The entire project (the making of three videos) will take eight to ten chunks in total, is my guess.

And then it was time for another break: I went for a walk, enjoyed a good lunch, and I read a bit of news and a chapter of a non-fiction book. Admittedly, reading non-fiction could count as a chunk of work, but I didn’t record the time stamps. It’s sometimes hard for me to decide where business ends and pleasure starts. 🙂

At the end of my 30-minute walk, I ended up at one of my favorite coffee bars in Brussels. A perfect place for me to relax, work, and stay focused. This is how I spent the afternoon…

Chunk eight was a collection of lots of unrelated small tasks. Basically, I cleaned out my task list, so that I only had a few larger items remaining. It took me 45 minutes. It’s another example of a grouping of activities. As usual, I was entirely focused. No emails, no Twitter, no Facebook, no Slack, just killing tasks.

In chunk nine I picked up testing the web shop again, after team member Hannu notified me that he had implemented some fixes. Yay! I could now test everything and this took me about 50 minutes.

Coffee break! (well earned)

I then spent 35 minutes booking flights and arranging hotels in chunk number ten, for a trip to Erlangen (Germany) and Manchester (UK). Again, it was a grouping of smaller tasks, although these were strongly related. Booking hotels and flights for several trips in one session saves me a bit of time.

The last four chunks were all rather small: handling emails I had received during the day (10 minutes), processing highlights I had made in some Kindle books (10 minutes), calculating new shipping fees for the web shop (15 minutes), and a bunch of small unrelated tasks that somehow popped up out of nowhere (10 minutes). There was another coffee break somewhere in between, I’m sure, and I wrapped it up with 15 minutes of relaxed reading and a nice 30-minute walk to be home for dinner.

I had a few more chunks of productivity in the evening after dinner, two of them involved the writing of this blog post.


### No Pomodoro Technique
Some readers may point out the similarity of my **chunking technique** to the [pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), which is about cutting up work into 25-minute timeboxes and then forcing yourself to take a break.

Despite the similarity of focusing on one activity, not getting distracted, and taking regular breaks, I want to emphasize the crucial difference: **Unlike pomodoros, chunks have different natural sizes**. I really don’t see the point of setting a kitchen timer that will interrupt me in my work after 25 minutes. Several of my chunks lasted 35 minutes and then they were done. Why would I allow myself to be interrupted at the 25th minute? It would break my flow! It would also cause stress and more task-switching. And what’s wrong with a sequence of focused smaller chunks of 10 or 15 minutes each? My average chunk size last Friday was about 28 minutes. That’s almost the same as the default timebox in the pomodoro technique. But I prefer the variety and flexibility of my chunking method over the rigidity of a kitchen timer. **A task is done when it’s done, not when a bell is ringing**.

**The pomodoro technique is like a wall of same-sized bricks. The chunking method is like a wall of silly-sized stones.**


### Conclusion
OK, maybe I am a bit more disciplined and productive than other people. It’s not that difficult, really.

- Focus on one thing at a time and don’t let yourself be distracted.
- If work takes more than an hour to do, cut it up in chunks that each take less than an hour to complete.
- If you have lots of little things to do, bundle them into bigger chunks that take at least 10 minutes each.
- Allow yourself frequent little breaks between the chunks to clear your mind and enjoy your progress and accomplishments.

That’s all there is to it, really.

**Note that it’s OK to work on different projects!** I can work on a presentation, a blog post, a courseware module, a website, and a video interview, all on the same day. In fact, there’s evidence this may help you be more creative. (Professor [David Burkus](http://davidburkus.com/) told me today that ongoing work that you’ve “parked” in your brain can be “incubating”, which generates more creative ideas.) However, you should still prevent task-switching by chunking: build your colorful wall **one stone at a time**.

p.s. This post was written in four chunks: Chunk one was the first half of a draft version (30 minutes), and chunk two was the second half of the draft version (40 minutes). I did both on Friday. Chunk three was a complete polished version (45 minutes), and chunk four was the publication on this blog (45 minutes). I did both on the next Monday.
